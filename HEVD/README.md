# HEVD

A folder dedicated to exploits for HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver 3. All exploits are written for Windows 10, x64. The build number varies between exploit but generally exploits are written for RS1, RS4 or RS6. Mostly RS4. I'll try to make it obvious which exploit are for which systems.

# Building

To compile the exploits the simplest way is to use cygwin64 and compile with `x86_64-w64_mingw32-gcc.exe -o exploit.exe exploit.c -lpsapi`
